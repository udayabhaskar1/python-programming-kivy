Python, Kivy

Assignment:

Task:
You are to plan and then code a console-based program in Python 3, as described in the following information and sample output. This assignment will help you build skills using selection, repetition, file input/output, exceptions, lists, functions and string formatting. Do not to define any of your own classes. Assignment 2 will build on this program with more advanced code constructs including classes and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Work incrementally on this task: complete small parts of it at a time rather than trying to get it all working at once. Some requirements have in-text references like [0] that refer to the resources list near the bottom. Everything you need to know to complete this assignment can be found in the subject materials.

Program Overview:
This program is a simple reading list that allows a user to track books they wish to read and books they have completed reading. The program maintains a list of books in a file, and each book has:
â€¢	title, author, number of pages, whether it is required or completed (r or c)
Users can choose to see the list of required books or completed books, including a total of the number of pages of the book list. The lists will be sorted by author then by number of pages (increasing). [1]
Users can add new books and mark books as completed. 
They cannot change books from completed to required.


Kivy Task:
To create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) version of the program using Python 3 and the Kivy toolkit This assignment will help to build skills using classes and GUIs as well as giving you more practice using techniques like selection, repetition, exceptions, lists, file I/O and functions. Some requirements have in-text references like [0] that refer to the resources list near the bottom. Everything you need to know to complete this assignment can be found in the subject materials.
